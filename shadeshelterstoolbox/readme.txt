In windows, the above folder and ruby file typically goes in this directory:  C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\SketchUp\SketchUp 2016\SketchUp\Plugins
In SketchUp, look in Window>Preferences and select Extentions, then check the Shade Shelters Toolbox checkbox.
Restart SketchUp and you should see a Extensions menu with a couple Shade Shelters Toolbox items.  The local one is for using a local server and the other one is using the online site.
The bulk of the work is done on the server.
I could share the ruby files if you'd like to be able to draw the shade shelters offline like a typical plugin.
